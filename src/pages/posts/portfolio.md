### Motivation

I wanted to try to build a pre-rendered site which shows the content immediately after the page is loaded. All of the apps in the last years are SPAs so this is something fresh for me.

I've chosen Svelte Kit because lately I've enjoyed writing app in Svelte. I've also chosen to use Tailwind with Daisy UI because it's something new for me and I wanted to give it a chance whether it might be a lighter substitute of React MUI.

It's the first project which is developed completely in cloud. I have never checked-out the repository. I use GitPod for development.

### 2nd version

I rewrote the app sing Astro. The reason was that I wanted to try that framework and specifically View Transition API. At that time Astro added 1st class support for that and after checking how easy it is to use it I continued rewriting entire app.

The other benefit was that I could get rid of an external API to fetch the content and use Markdown files instead for all the posts.
