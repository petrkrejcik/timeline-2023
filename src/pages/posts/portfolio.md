<h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Motivation</h2>

I wanted to try to build a prerendered site which shows the content immediately after the page is loaded. All of the apps in the last years are SPAs so this is something fresh for me.

<br />
I've chosen Svelte Kit because lately I've enjoyed writing app in Svelte. I've also chosen to use Tailwind with Daisy UI because it's something new for me and I wanted to give it a chance whether it might be a lighter substitute of React MUI.

It's the first project which is developed completely in cloud. I have never checked-out the repository. I use GitPod for development.

<br />

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold">2nd version</h2>

I rewrote the app sing Astro. The reason was that I wanted to try that framework and specifically View Transition API. At that time Astro added 1st class support for that and after checking how easy it is to use it I continued rewriting entire app.

The other benefit was that I could get rid of an external API to fetch the content and use Markdown files instead for all the posts.
