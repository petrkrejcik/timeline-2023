I was a part of a global team which was developing a platform for video streaming on demand. The platform was used by major media companies in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia and Rumunia.

<br />

I was also developing the same application for various devices (TVs and set-top boxes). The UI was is because a user doesn't have a mouse.
