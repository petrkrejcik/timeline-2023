I was a part of a global team which was developing a platform for video streaming on demand. The platform was used by major media companies in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia and Rumunia.

<br />

I was for the first time truly focused mainly on frontend.

I also worked on a lighter version of Publisher which was a PWA.
