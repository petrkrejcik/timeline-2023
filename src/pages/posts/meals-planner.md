### Motivation

It solves our family's daily question: "What will we eat today?". Instead of answering the question everyday we plan the meal by weekly basis and input the meals in the app. The app offers meals which we know how to prepare and allows to filters meals suitable for children or ideal for a dinner.

### First version

When I create a personal project I usually choose some new technology out of my curiosity. At the time of starting with this app I wanted to try Svelte. So I chose that library.

### Second version

One day I decided to rewrite the app to Qwik.
